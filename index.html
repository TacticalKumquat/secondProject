		<h1 id="title">How to Prepare for Camping</h1>  <!--why, when, where, who, what, food, supplies-->	<!--Title-->
		<p>Camping is a great outdoor activity, with lots of variability.  I've gone on campouts where I hiked, canoed, or just relaxed.  However, not everyone knows how to go about planning a campout, and that is what this website is for.</p>
		</div>		<!--one-->

		<div class="Why">
		<h3 id="why">Deciding Why You are Camping</h3> <!--capitalize all letters?-->
		<p>The first decision to be made when you are planning a campout is why you are doing it.  This might get overlooked, but it is essential to have an idea of what will be done on the trip.  Will you hike to the campsite?  Are you camping near a cave to do spelunking during the trip?  Are you just planning to lounge around?</p>
		</div> 		<!--why-->

		<div class="Outline">
		<h3 id="outline">Creating an Outline</h3>
		<p>Before getting into the specifics of the campout, put together a basic outline of the trips.  This should not be final or very in-depth, just a list of what you might do each day, in the order they will be done as much as possible.  Include meals, activities, etc.</p>
		</div>		<!--outline-->

		<div class="Location">
		<h3 id="location">Finding a Location</h3>
		<p>Now that you have a basic overview of your trip, it is time to find a location.  If you don’t have anywhere in mind you can search for one on a search engine (like google), or you can ask friends if you think they might have suggestions.  Once you have a location, make sure to check for any fees and necessary registration, along with rules.</p>
		</div>		<!--location-->

		<div class="Schedule>
		<h3 id="schedule">Creating a Schedule</h3>
		<p>With the location(s) chosen, you can now go back to your outline and revise it with any specific times that the place chosen might have confirmed. </p>
		</div>		<!--schedule-->

		<div class="Who">
		<h3 id="who">Find out who is Going</h3>
		<p>If you haven’t done this already, create a list of who is going on the campout.  Be sure to mark any special needs, medications, food allergies, etc.</p>
		</div>		<!--who-->

		<div class="Menu">
		<h3 id="menu">Deciding on a Menu Plan</h3>
		<p>Now comes the fun part (in my opinion), food!  Plan each meal with food that can be easily prepared, and make sure to get food everybody will like.  Don’t forget drinks (juice jugs, drink mixes) and snacks, even if it is just to tell everyone to bring their own.  For the meals themselves, keep in mind where you will be and what you will be doing when you eat it.  One thing I enjoy doing is finding something new for dinner the night before the campout ends.  We normally have little happening at that time, so it is a perfect time to do a bigger meal.</p>
		</div>		<!--menu-->

		<div class="Bring">
		<h3 id="bring">Planning What to Bring</h3>
		<p>Of course, if you are camping you should make sure you have everything you need.  It would be impossible for me to tell you exactly what you need, since there are so many ways to camp.  However, some things that should be kept in mind are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Food</li>
			<li>Water and water bottles</li>
			<li>Mess kit (utensils and plate/bowl)</li>
			<li>Tent/hammock</li>
			<li>Blanket or sleeping bag</li>
			<li>First Aid kit</li>
			<li>Extra clothes</li>
			<li>Flashlights</li>
			<li>Materials for starting and maintaining a fire</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This is a simple list, and I suggest you consult someone more qualified on what you should bring.</p>
